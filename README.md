3D files for Jesse's chronic neuropixel holders. All designs were modified in tinkercad from the original holders used for rats found in [Luo, Bondy, et al. 2020 eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/59716)

Production 2.0 internal holder modified in collaboration with Rob Fetcho.

For other holders (that were designed for mice from the start) please see [the apollo](https://github.com/Coen-Lab/chronic-neuropixels) or [the indie](https://github.com/spkware/chronic_holder)

Feel free to contact me about these designs with any questions at jkaminsky@princeton.edu
