3D files for Jesse's chronic neuropixel holders. All designs were modified in tinkercad from the original holders used for rats found in [Luo, Bondy, et al. 2020 eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/59716)

Production 2.0 internal holder modified in collaboration with [Rob Fetcho](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SHq1IlIAAAAJ&hl=en).

Narrower versions of production 2.0s by [Jorge Yanar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Estf_eEAAAAJ&hl=en).

For other holders (that were designed for mice from the start) please see [the apollo](https://github.com/Coen-Lab/chronic-neuropixels) or [the indie](https://github.com/spkware/chronic_holder)

Feel free to contact me about these designs with any questions at jkaminsky@princeton.edu
