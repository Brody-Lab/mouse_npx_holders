# The Tuckbox - neuropixel 2.0 holders for chronic electrophysiology in mice

Printable files for Jesse Kaminsky's chronic neuropixel holders. All designs were modified in tinkercad from the original holders used for rats found in [this repo](https://github.com/agbondy/neuropixels_2.0_implant_assembly). Because of this I currently only have mesh files for these designs, and no true 3d structural file. Someday I'll learn an actual 3D modelling software...

Assembly instructions are [here](https://github.com/Brody-Lab/mouse_npx_holders/blob/main/Neuropixels%202.0%20Implant%20Assembly%20Instructions.pdf).

Production 2.0 internal holder modified in collaboration with [Rob Fetcho](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SHq1IlIAAAAJ&hl=en).

Narrower versions of production 2.0s by [Jorge Yanar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Estf_eEAAAAJ&hl=en).

There is also a version of the narrower holders with a cap, allowing complete protection of the probe without any protective wrapping (for single-housed mice). However, this is a work in progress so use at your own risk.

For other holders (that were designed for mice from the start) please see [this awesome resource](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/awesome_neuropixels).

Feel free to contact me about these designs with any questions at jkaminsky@princeton.edu
